When he returns to his neighborhood, he is stunned by the brutal changes, and recklessly joins a girl in rebelling.",
      "our_take": "Charlie vs. Adolf! In his most controversial film yet (as well as his first “talkie”), Chaplin took on fascism with subversive humor, trademark slapstick, and a feast of now-classic scenes. The final speech is legendary, and the “globe dance” is wicked and perverse. An absolute essential. ",

Hopping from Morocco to Bologna for his first film shot in color, Pasolini fashions a hugely ambitious, three-part epic of modern mythmaking.",
